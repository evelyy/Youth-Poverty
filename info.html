            <big><font color="red">731,300</big></font> children in Australia are living in poverty, as shown in a survey conducted by the Australian Council of Social Service.<br>This is equivalent to<big><font color="red"> 17.1%</font></big> of every child in Australia, and is 4.1% higher than the average poverty rate in Australia.<br>
            This figure is  <big><font color="red">up</font></big> 2% over the past decade (2004-2014)<br>Children in single parent families are significantly more  likely to be in poverty, at <big><font color="red">40.6%</font></big>, compared to a 12.5% rate for couple families

            <big><font color="red">3,000,000</big></font> people are living in poverty in Australia<hr>
            In 1987, Prime Minister Bob Hawke famously proclaimed "by <big><font color="red">1990</font></big>, no Australian child will be living in poverty".<br>
