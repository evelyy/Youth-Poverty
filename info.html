            <big><font color="red">731,300</big></font> (17.1%) of all children in Australia are living in poverty.<br>
            This figure is up 2% over the past decade (2004-2014)<br>
            <big><font color="red">3,000,000</big></font> people are living in poverty in Australia<br>
            In 1987, Prime Minister Bob Hawke famously proclaimed "by <big><font color="red">1990</font></big>, no Australian child will be living in poverty".<br>
            This <big><font color="red">violates</font></big> the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child, which Australia signed in November of 1989, clearly states in Article <big><font color="red">6</font></big>, "Children have the right to live a full life", Article <big><font color="red">24</font></big>, "Children have the right to good quality health care, clean water, nutritious food, and a clean environment so that they will stay healthy", Article <big><font color="red">26</font></big>, "The Government should provide extra money to families in need", Article <big><font color="red">27</font></big>, "Children have a right to a standard of living that is good enough to meet their physical and mental needs", Article <big><font color="red">28</font></big>, "Children have the right to an education", Article <big><font color="red">31</font></big>, "Children have the right to relax, play, and join in a wide range of leisure activities", Article <big><font color="red">36</font></big>, "Children should be protected from any activities that may hurt their development", and Article <big><font color="red">42</font></big>, "The Government should make the Convention clearly known to all parents and children".
