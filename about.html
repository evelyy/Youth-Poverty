    <h1>this is a thing made by mitch and tom<br><hr>
    the aim for our project was to raise awareness for the massive issue of youth poverty in Australia alone. Whilst we are not directly affected by this issue, we still feel sympathy for the children the same age of us living on the streets of Australia. The very fact that, just because we were born to a different family means we get such vastly different opportunities simply seems backwards, and we would like to do something about it.</h1>
